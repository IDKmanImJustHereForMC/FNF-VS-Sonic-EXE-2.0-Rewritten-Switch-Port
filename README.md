# FNF-VS-Sonic-EXE-2.0-Rewritten-Switch-Port
The source code for a small project with the simple goal of porting FNF Vs Sonic EXE (Specifically 2.0) to switch. This port is NOT 1:1, and may have some stuff missing or changed.

To respect GameBanana's current Disapproval of most Sonic.EXE related content, this port, when finished, will NOT be uploaded there. It instead will be uploaded to alternative sites.

# Installation
As of now, there is NO public pre-built release of the current version, you may use or build the source code yourself.

# Disclaimer
As of now, this port may NOT run on Switch consoles well, things like Faker and Chaos don't run well or just don't run at all. This is hopefully being fixed.

This port is also NOT COMPLETE. Things that are in development may NOT HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY UPLOADED HERE, and may not work, it is best to just wait for the final version.

# Why specifically 2.0?
Though the port may borrow from later versions, I simply chose 2.0 because it was the latest COMPLETE build, that and it had significantly less workload than 2.5/3.0 does.

# Funkin' Rewritten
This port is built off Funkin' Rewritten, a fanmade version of FNF made with the love2d engine and made to optimize for lower end PCs, and of course, run on Switch.
